# pdfsplitter
## Separates a multi-page pdf into 1-page pdfs in a folder labeled `pages`

## Run code with either of:
`python splitpdf.py <file.pdf>`

`python splitpdf.py`

## Install Dependencies
`pip install PyPDF2`

## Notes:
* combining files needs to be tested on Windows
because there might be a bug in Tkinter's askopenfiles
method

## Future Plans:
* Verify the order of files to combine
* Place combined/split file(s) into same directory
	ask original file(s)
