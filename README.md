# pdf splitter
Separate a multi-page pdf into 1-page pdfs.

Combine several pdf files into one pdf.

## Run with:
`python view.py`

## Install Dependencies
`pip install PyPDF2`

## Needed to make the executable:
`pip install pyinstaller` 

## Future Plans:
* Currently messages that tell the user what is going on are only displayed in the commandline. It would be helpful to add these to the UI.
* Add a button on the listbox dialog to allow user to select additional files to combine. 
* Create a visual cue to remind the user whether in combine or split mode.
* Have a default filename/path shown in the dialog box in case the user forgets to write it in the 'save as' box.
